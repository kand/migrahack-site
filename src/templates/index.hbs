            <h2>Rural Immigration</h2>
            <p>The immigrant population in Illinois is moving toward the suburbs and downstate. Since traditionally the majority of Illinois immigrant population has been centered in Chicago, the majority of immigrant services and social service infrastructure is based in the Chicagoland area. Without access to legal services, immigrants in rural and downstate Illinois are less likely to have adequate legal support while navigating the criminal justice system.</p>
            <p><i>12.3 percent of immigrant households had an immigration-related legal problem. 73.0 percent of immigrants with immigration-related legal needs did not have their problem addressed.</i></p>
